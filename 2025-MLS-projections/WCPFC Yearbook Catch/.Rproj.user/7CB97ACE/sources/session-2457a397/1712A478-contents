**2025-02-06 BILLWG MLS projection analysis discussion with Michelle**

-   Japan submitted catch biomass data in "jpn_mls_catch.csv"
    -   Catch units are kg, not tons
    -   2021 catch biomass is not included
    -   Catch data for 2023-2024 are not fully available
    -   2023-2024 catch data are carried over from 2022 catches
    -   Need to get 2021 data from Marko
-   USA catch biomass will be requested with PIFSC data request
    -   Jon will make the data request
    -   In interim, USA catch will be taken from WCPFC Yearbook values for 2021-2024, with carry over as needed for 2024
-   Taiwanese catch
    -   Will be taken from WCPFC Yearbook values for 2021-2024, with carry over as needed for 2024
-   Other catch data
    -   Will be taken from WCPFC Yearbook values for 2021-2024, with carry over as needed for 2024
-   Other changes to 2024 projection modeling approach
    -   Use Scenarios 1-3 for 2025-2027 catch biomass
    -   Calculate constant catch for 2028-2034 to meet MLS rebuilding target
    -   Need to extract catch biomass from base case SS3 output to apportion
    -   2021-2024 catches to fleet groups - this will require some additional coding
